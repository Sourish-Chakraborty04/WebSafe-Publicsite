WebSafe is a browser extension that uses machine learning to detect phishing websites in real time, helping users avoid scams, fake login pages, and malicious sites. This repository hosts the **public website** for the WebSafe project, built with modern web technologies and hosted via GitHub Pages.

## 🌐 What is WebSafe?

WebSafe is a privacy‑focused browser extension that analyzes URLs and page content using an ML model to classify sites as **safe** or **phishing**. It runs locally in the browser (or with a lightweight backend) and warns users before they enter credentials on suspicious pages.

### Why WebSafe?

- **Real‑time protection**: Scans URLs as you browse, not just from static blacklists.
- **ML‑powered detection**: Uses features like URL structure, domain age, and page content to catch new phishing sites.
- **Lightweight & fast**: Designed to work smoothly without slowing down your browser.
- **Open & transparent**: Code is open source so security researchers and developers can audit and improve it.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real‑time URL analysis using a trained ML model
- 🛑 Blocks or warns on detected phishing pages
- 📊 Clean popup UI showing site safety status
- 🧠 Feature extraction from URL, domain, and page content
- 🌐 Works as a Chrome/Edge extension (with potential for Firefox)
- 🛡️ Privacy‑first: minimal data collection, no unnecessary permissions

## 📖 How to Use

1. Install the WebSafe extension from the main repo and load it unpacked in developer mode.
2. Browse normally – the extension will automatically analyze URLs.
3. When a suspicious site is detected, you’ll see a warning pop-up.
4. Decide whether to proceed or go back to a safe page.

For detailed setup and usage, see the [docs](docs/) folder or the main extension README.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **URL Capture**: Extension captures the current tab’s URL.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features like URL length, domain age, special characters, etc.
3. **ML Prediction**: Sends features to the ML model via API for analysis.
4. **Result Display**: Shows a clear safety status (safe / phishing) in the pop-up.
5. **User Action**: User can choose to proceed or block the site.
